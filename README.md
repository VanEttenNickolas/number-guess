A simple number guessing game using Python. The computer will think of a random number between 1 and 100 (by importing random and using random_int to get a number between 1 and 100), 
and you have to guess what number it is. The program will keep looping until you guess the number correctly. 0, negative numbers, and any other inputs will give you an invalid input error. 

Hint: It will tell you if your guesses are either too low or too high (using if-else statements), which will help narrow down the correct response.
